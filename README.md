## 🛠️ Makefile Commands Overview
The commands in our `Makefile` enable you to manage the project lifecycle efficiently. Below is a brief overview of the updated command list that you can run with `make`:

- `make build`: Compiles the project, preparing it for execution.
- `make test`: Runs the suite of tests to ensure code integrity and detect regressions.
- `make install`: Installs the project on your system, copying necessary files to the appropriate directories.
- `make clean`: Cleans up the project, removing compiled objects and temporary files.
- `make doc`: Generates the project documentation for easy reference and developer onboarding.
- `make run ARGS="arg1 arg2"`: Executes the built project with the specified command-line arguments. Replace `arg1 arg2` with the actual arguments.

Remember, each `make` command is a convenience wrapper around a series of commands that you would otherwise need to run manually. We keep them updated to offer a seamless development experience.
