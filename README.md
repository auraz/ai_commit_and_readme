## 🛠️ Makefile Commands Overview
The Makefile is an essential component that automates the compilation, testing, and deployment of our project. Ensuring that you are up-to-date with the Makefile's latest commands will enhance your development workflow. Below is an updated list of relevant commands that you should be familiar with:

- `make build`: Compiles the project, ensuring that any new changes are integrated before deployment.
- `make test`: Runs a comprehensive suite of tests to verify the functionality and integrity of the project's codebase.
- `make install`: Installs the project's dependencies, setting up a proper environment for development and execution.
- `make clean`: Cleans up the project's directory by removing compiled objects and temporary files, maintaining a tidy workspace.
- `make deploy`: Simplifies the process of deploying the project to the designated environment or platform.

To use these commands, simply type `make <command>` in your terminal. For example, `make build` will trigger the compilation process.

Remember to review the Makefile periodically for any additional commands or modifications that can streamline your development process.
