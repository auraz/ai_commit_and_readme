## 🛠️ Makefile Commands Overview
Unfortunately, without the specific code changes included in your scenario, I cannot provide an updated section for the README.md. The enhancement of the documentation largely depends on the nature of the code changes, whether they involve new features, deprecated functions, performance improvements, or bug fixes.

Please provide the details of the code changes or specific areas within the Makefile that have been updated, and I will be able to suggest enhancements or modifications to the "Makefile Commands Overview" section or any other sections in the documentation that need to be revised.
