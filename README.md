- `make test` - Runs the entire suite of automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
- `make install` - Installs the project onto your system. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute this command.
- `make clean` - Removes all generated files from the build process, restoring the directory to a pre-build state.
