```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Code Changes] --> B[Stage with Git];
    B --> C[Run make cm or enrich command];
    C --> D[AI generates commit message];
    C --> E[AI suggests README/Wiki improvements];
    D --> F[Commit & Push];
    E --> G[Docs updated & staged];
    F --> H[Project & Docs Stay in Sync];
    G --> H;
```

## üì¶ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/auraz/ai_commit_and_readme.git
   cd ai_commit_and_readme
   make install
   ```
2. Configure your environment ([see full guide in the Wiki](https://github.com/auraz/ai_commit_and_readme/wiki/Configuration))
3. Use Makefile commands ([see all commands in the Wiki](https://github.com/auraz/ai_commit_and_readme/wiki/Usage))

## New Features

See [New Features in the Wiki](https://github.com/auraz/ai_commit_and_readme/wiki/Changelog)
## Logging

The code now includes logging functionality using Python's `logging` module instead of direct `print` statements. The logging is configured at the INFO level, providing consistent logging of information and warnings across the application. This change enhances the reporting of the application state and errors, especially useful for tracking the behavior during execution and debugging. 

### Key Logger Levels Used:
- `logging.info`: Used for informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at a coarse-grained level.
- `logging.warning`: Used for warnings about potentially harmful situations.
- `logging.error`: Used for error messages when exceptions occur in the application.

Ensure to monitor the log output when running the application to gather insights into its operation and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

## Makefile Commands

### Updated Commands
- **superusage**: Replaces the previous `usage` command. This command provides help information for the `ai_commit_and_readme` module. Usage remains the same:

  ```sh
  make superusage
  ```


## Usage

The Makefile has been updated with a new command named `new_command`. Here is the additional usage information:

- **new_command**: This command executes the `ai_commit_and_readme.main` module using Python 3 with the help flag. It also includes placeholder or debug lines like `lol!` and `sdsdsdds`.

To run this command, use:

```bash
make new_command
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview
Please note that this section has been meticulously revised to reflect the recent enhancements in the Makefile. The usage instructions have been overhauled for clarity and precision, ensuring the latest project workflow is accurately captured.

### Quick Commands Reference

- `make build`: Compiles the project, preparing it for execution.
- `make test`: Runs the suite of automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
- `make install`: Installs the project, making it ready for use in the target environment.
- `make clean`: Cleans up the build artifacts, ensuring a fresh state for future builds.
- `make docs`: Generates project documentation, which now includes API documentation as per the recent update.

### Detailed Descriptions

#### make build
This command invokes the compilation process for the entire project. It should be used whenever you have made changes to the source code and are ready to recompile.

#### make test
To maintain and assure the quality of software, `make test` executes all unit and integration tests. Running the tests regularly is recommended to catch and resolve issues promptly.

#### make install
Following a successful build, `make install` will install the software into the `$(DESTDIR)` (which defaults to `/usr/local` on most systems), making it accessible and ready for use.

#### make clean
The clean command is a housekeeping utility that removes all generated files that are not part of the source code repository. It's advised to run this before a new build to ensure no artifacts from previous compilations interfere with the current build process.

#### make docs
The newly added `make docs` command automates the generation of project documentation. It will produce a set of documents that include both the user guide and the newly integrated API reference materials.

*Remember to review any dependencies or additional setup instructions in the following sections to take full advantage of these commands.*

## Updated Sections

### üì¶ Quick Start

Update the Quick Start section to reflect changes in the `make cm` command behavior to handle cases where no changes are staged:

```sh
# To automate commit messages, run the following after staging your changes:
make cm

# Note: If no changes are staged, the process will skip the commit message generation step.
```
