## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview
Following the latest changes in our project's Makefile, we've streamlined the commands to enhance developer productivity and simplify project management. Here's the updated overview of our Makefile commands:

- `make build`: Compiles the project, preparing it for execution.
- `make test`: Runs the suite of automated tests to ensure code integrity and reliability.
- `make install`: Installs the project dependencies, setting up the necessary environment for development and execution.
- `make run`: Executes the compiled project, allowing you to see it in action immediately.
- `make clean`: Cleans up the project, removing compiled objects and clearing temporary files to maintain a tidy workspace.
- `make docs`: Generates the project documentation, ensuring that you have access to the latest help files and usage examples.
- `make all`: A combination command that executes `make clean`, followed by `make build`, and `make test` sequentially, ensuring a clean state and validation of changes.

Note that some commands might have prerequisites or may only be suitable for certain environments. Always refer to the detailed documentation provided in `Usage.md` for comprehensive guidelines and platform-specific notes.
