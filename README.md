## üìã AI-Powered Evaluation Tools

Analyze and improve your documentation quality using OpenAI-powered evaluations:

```sh
# Evaluate a README file with AI feedback
python -m ai_commit_and_readme.cli eval-readme README.md



# Evaluate wiki pages with specialized content-aware criteria
python -m ai_commit_and_readme.cli eval-wiki wiki/Installation.md

# Evaluate all wiki pages in a directory with specialized criteria
python -m ai_commit_and_readme.cli eval-wiki wiki --dir

# Specify a wiki page type manually
python -m ai_commit_and_readme.cli eval-wiki wiki/API.md --type api
```

> **Note:** Requires an OpenAI API key set as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Supported Wiki Page Types

The wiki evaluator automatically detects the following page types and applies specialized evaluation criteria:

- API Documentation
- Architecture
- CI/CD
- Changelog
- Configuration
- Contributing
- Deployment
- FAQ
- Home/Index
- Installation
- Security
- Usage

Each page type is evaluated with metrics specifically designed for that content category.

## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview
In light of recent updates, our Makefile now supports a wider array of commands to streamline your workflow. Below you'll find a comprehensive overview of the Makefile commands to ensure efficient usage.

- `make build`: Compiles the project and generates the executable. It's the go-to command before you start using the application for the first time or after you've pulled new changes from the repository.

- `make test`: Runs the full suite of automated tests to ensure that the application maintains functionality. It's a critical step to validate that new code changes don't break existing features.

- `make clean`: Removes all generated files, clearing the workspace. This is useful when you want to get rid of build artifacts cluttering up your directory, especially before a fresh build.

- `make install`: Installs the application on your system, giving you easy access from the command line. Use this after a successful build to start using the software right away.

- `make all`: This is a convenience command that combines building, testing, and cleaning operations. It ensures that you've got a fresh, tested build ready to go.

Please refer to the Usage.md document for detailed descriptions and examples on how to use each of the Makefile commands to manage your project efficiently.

**Note:** Always ensure you have the correct permissions to execute Makefile commands, especially for `make install`, which may require administrative privileges on some systems.
