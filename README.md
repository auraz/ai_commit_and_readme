- `make build`: Assembles the project, compiling source files into executable binaries or libraries.
- `make test`: Runs a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure your changes meet the existing behavioral specifications.
- `make install`: Installs the project binaries onto your system, making it usable from anywhere within your environment.
- `make clean`: Cleans up the project, removing compiled objects and temporary files to maintain a tidy workspace.
