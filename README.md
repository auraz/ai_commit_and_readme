## 🛠️ Makefile Commands Overview
Due to recent updates to the project's Makefile, please refer to the following updated commands for setting up, building, and maintaining the project:

- `make install`: Installs the project dependencies.
- `make build`: Compiles the source code and creates the application executable.
- `make test`: Runs the suite of tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
- `make clean`: Removes any generated files that are not needed for execution and resets the project to a clean state.
- `make deploy`: Deploys the application to the configured environment, ensuring all necessary configurations are considered.

Please note that each of these commands is designed to be run from the root of the project directory. For detailed usage and additional options, refer to the Usage.md document.

Remember to stay up-to-date with these commands as they may change with further updates to the Makefile. It is also recommended to run `make help` to display all current commands and their descriptions directly in your terminal.
