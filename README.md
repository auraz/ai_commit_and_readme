## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview
Please consult the updated Makefile for the latest commands and usage scenarios for our project. The Makefile is designed to be simple and intuitive, making the build process seamless for both newcomers and veterans alike.

For example, to compile the project, you'd simply use:

```sh
make build
```

If there have been changes that affect the testing procedures, for instance, the addition of a new testing suite or expanded testing commands, you would see those reflected here with descriptions on how to invoke them:

```sh
make test
```

Additional commands are also documented, providing you with options for cleaning up build artifacts, generating documentation, or other common tasks:

```sh
make clean  # Remove build artifacts
make docs   # Generate project documentation
```

Always run `make help` to see the list of available commands directly in your terminal. Our Makefile is regularly updated to introduce optimizations and new functionality, so we recommend checking back often for the latest command set.
