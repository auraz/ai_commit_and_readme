## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview
We've refined our Makefile to streamline your development process. The updated commands are designed to be intuitive and powerful, allowing you to perform common tasks with ease. Key changes include the addition of a `test` target that runs unit tests, an `install-deps` target to simplify dependency management, and enhancements to the `clean` command for more thorough cleanup.

- `make build`: Compiles the source code and creates an executable file.
- `make test`: Executes the unit tests to ensure your code modifications haven't introduced any regressions.
- `make install-deps`: Installs or updates the necessary dependencies for your project.
- `make clean`: Now removes all generated files, including binaries, logs, and temporary files created during testing.

Remember to check out our detailed Usage guidelines in `Usage.md` for more information on these commands.
