## 🛠️ Makefile Commands Overview
*[The following section has been updated to reflect the latest changes in the Makefile. We've made sure that each command is up-to-date and accurately described for users to understand and use efficiently.]*

- `make build`: Compiles the project, ensuring that any changes in the source code are reflected in the output.
- `make test`: Runs the suite of automated tests for the project, verifying that the code behaves as expected after changes.
- `make clean`: Removes all generated files that are created during the build process, allowing for a fresh start.
- `make install`: Installs the necessary dependencies for the project, ensuring that the user has all the required software to run the application.
- `make doc`: Generates the project documentation, inclusive of the latest changes and features included in the codebase.
- `make deploy`: Deploys the application to the specified environment, automating the process of getting the software into production.

*[Please note that 'make doc' is a recently-added command; users should run this command after any significant updates to the codebase to maintain up-to-date documentation.]*

---

Remember to run `make doc` after you have made significant changes to your codebase to ensure your documentation remains current. The `doc` target is a relatively new addition aimed at improving the developer experience by simplifying the documentation generation process.
