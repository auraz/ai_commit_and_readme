## 🛠️ Makefile Commands Overview
Please refer to this section after each code update to familiarize yourself with the current make commands. Make sure to have `make` utility installed on your system to use these commands.

- `make build` - Compiles the code and creates an executable file.
- `make test` - Runs all the unit tests to ensure the code behaves as expected.
- `make install` - Installs the application on your system, typically by copying files to the appropriate directories.
- `make clean` - Cleans up the directory, removing any temporary files or build artifacts.

(Note: The above commands are just an example. The actual command list may vary depending on the included Makefile changes.)
