## 🛠️ Makefile Commands Overview

The `Makefile` included in this project streamlines complex command-line operations to simplify your development workflow. A quick overview of the additions and changes:

- `make build`: Compiles the project and generates the necessary binary files.
- `make test`: Run all the tests within the project to ensure that everything is functioning as expected.
- `make install`: Installs the project on your local system (updated to reflect the new installation path).
- `make doc`: Generate the project's documentation (newly added command for convenience).
- `make clean`: Removes all generated files and cleans up the project directory.

Please refer to the [Usage.md](Usage.md) file for detailed information on each command and its effects.
