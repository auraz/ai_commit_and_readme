## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview
Due to recent changes in the project's Makefile, it is essential to ensure that all users have access to the most current command information. Below is an overview of the updated Makefile commands you can use for various tasks when working with our project:

- `make build`: Compiles the project, preparing it for execution.
- `make test`: Runs a comprehensive suite of automated tests to verify the functionality of the project.
- `make install`: Installs the project and its dependencies onto the local machine. This may involve downloading required libraries or other components.
- `make clean`: Cleans up the generated files and artifacts from the build process, leaving a tidy workspace.
- `make deploy`: Deploys the project to the designated environment, which may be staging or production depending on configuration settings.
- `make docs`: Generate up-to-date project documentation, ensuring that API references, guides, and samples reflect the most recent changes.

Each of these commands can be run from the terminal within the project's root directory. For some commands, there may be additional options or flags; consult the Makefile directly for the most precise usage details.
