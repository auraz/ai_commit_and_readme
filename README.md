## üìã AI-Powered Evaluation Tools

Analyze and improve your documentation quality using CrewAI-powered evaluations:

```sh
# Evaluate a README file with AI feedback
just eval-readme README.md

# Evaluate wiki pages with AI-powered analysis
just eval-wiki wiki/Installation.md

# Evaluate wiki pages with specific type
just eval-wiki wiki/API.md api

# Evaluate all wiki pages in a directory
just eval-wiki-dir wiki
```

> **Note:** Requires an OpenAI API key set as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

### CrewAI Integration with Type-Specific Prompts

The evaluation system uses [autodoceval-crewai](https://github.com/auraz/autodoceval-crewai) enhanced with specialized evaluation prompts for different wiki page types. This hybrid approach provides:

- **CrewAI agents**: Collaborative evaluation with multi-agent framework
- **Type-specific prompts**: Tailored evaluation criteria for each documentation type
- **Automatic type detection**: Identifies document type from content and filename
- **Specialized feedback**: Context-aware suggestions based on document purpose

Supported wiki page types with custom evaluation criteria:
- API Documentation (endpoints, parameters, authentication)
- Architecture (system design, components, diagrams)
- Installation (prerequisites, setup steps, troubleshooting)
- Usage (examples, workflows, best practices)
- Security (authentication, vulnerabilities, best practices)
- Contributing (guidelines, development setup, PR process)
