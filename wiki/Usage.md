  "updated_sections": "# Usage\n\nThis project utilizes a Makefile to streamline common development tasks. Below are the main commands and their usage, including recent updates that enhance functionality and usability:\n\n---\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview\nThe Makefile is equipped with various commands to facilitate building and managing the project. Below, you will find a comprehensive list of currently supported commands and their descriptions:\n\n- **`make build`** - Compiles the source code into an executable.\n- **`make test`** - Runs the test suite to validate the integrity of the code.\n- **`make install`** - Sets up a virtual environment, installs Python dependencies, and installs `aicommit`.\n- **`make clean`** - Removes build artifacts, caches, and all `__pycache__` directories.\n- **`make doc`** - Generates the project documentation.\n- **`make all`** - Executes the `build`, `test`, and `doc` commands in sequence.\n- **`make cm`** - Stages all changes, generates an AI-powered commit message, and pushes to the remote repository. This command also runs both `ai-commit-and-readme` and `aicommit`.\n- **`make commit`** - Executes a commit without pushing. This command is useful for local testing before finalizing changes.\n\nEach command is designed to streamline the development process, ensuring a consistent and efficient workflow. The Makefile is also configured with sensible defaults and dependency checks to prevent unnecessary recompilation.\n\n## üöÄ Common Workflows\n\n### Install Everything\n```sh\nmake install\n```\n- Sets up a virtual environment, installs Python dependencies, and installs `aicommit`.\n\n### Testing\n```sh\nmake test\n```\n- Runs all tests using pytest.\n\n### Cleaning\n```sh\nmake clean\n```\n- Removes build artifacts, caches, and all `__pycache__` directories.\n\n### AI Commit and Push\n```sh\nmake cm\n```\n- Stages all changes, generates an AI-powered commit message, and pushes to the remote repository. This command runs both `ai-commit-and-readme` and `aicommit`.\n\n### Deploy Wiki\n```sh\nmake deploy-wiki\n```\n- Copies the contents of your local `wiki/` directory to the GitHub Wiki repository and pushes the changes.\n\n## üìù Notes\n- All commands assume you are in the project root directory.\n- For more advanced usage and automation, see the [FAQ](FAQ) and [Configuration](Configuration) pages.\n- If you encounter issues, check your environment variables and configuration.\n\n## üìù Changelog\n- **New Commands Added:** `make commit` and `make cm` for enhanced commit workflows.\n- **Method Update:** The `BaseCrew` class in `base.py` now returns an output from its method, improving usability.\n\n---\n\nRemember to review the individual commands within the Makefile for further details and options. This documentation aims to ensure users can quickly understand how to use the software's build system with minimal confusion or trial and error.\n",
