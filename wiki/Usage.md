## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview

In our project, we utilize a Makefile to simplify the management of common development tasks. Below is a curated list of Makefile commands that you will find useful during your work with our project:

- `make build`: Compiles the project source code into an executable. Must be run before attempting to execute the program.
- `make test`: Runs a suite of unit tests to ensure code integrity and catch any bugs before they slip into production.
- `make clean`: Cleans up the project directory by removing any compiled files and temporary objects. This is often a good idea to do before a fresh build.
- `make install`: Installs the project on your local machine. Depending on the project, this may involve copying files to certain locations or updating system configurations.
- `make all`: A combination command that runs `clean`, followed by `build`, and then `test`, ensuring a clean environment for a full quality check.

Always ensure you're in the root directory of the project before executing any of these commands.
