# Usage

This project uses a Makefile to simplify common development tasks. Below are the main commands and their usage:

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview
The following section has been reviewed and updated to reflect the recent changes to the Makefile:

### Building the Project
To build the project, navigate to the project's root directory and run:
```
make build
```
This command will compile all the necessary files and produce the executable necessary to run the project.

### Cleaning Build Artifacts
If you need to clean up the compiled files and other build artifacts, run:
```
make clean
```
This will remove all the non-source-code files that were generated during the build process, leaving a clean slate.

### Running Tests
Testing is a critical part of development. To run the available tests, execute:
```
make test
```
This will invoke the testing suite and output the test results, allowing you to ensure that your code is functioning as expected.

Each make command has been carefully crafted to simplify the developer‚Äôs workflow. Refer to the Makefile for additional custom commands that can speed up your development process.

## üöÄ Common Workflows

### Install Everything
```sh
make install
```
- Sets up a virtual environment, installs Python dependencies, and installs `aicommit`.

### Testing
```sh
make copverage
```
- Runs all tests using pytest.

### Cleaning
```sh
make clean
```
- Removes build artifacts, caches, and all `__pycache__` directories.

### AI Commit and Push
```sh
make cm
```
- Stages all changes, generates an AI-powered commit message, and pushes to the remote repository.
- Runs both `ai-commit-and-readme` and `aicommit`.


### Deploy Wiki
```sh
make deploy-wiki
```
- Copies the contents of your local `wiki/` directory to the GitHub Wiki repository and pushes the changes.
