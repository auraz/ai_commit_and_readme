## üöÄ Common Workflows

### Install Everything
```sh
make install
```
- Sets up a virtual environment, installs Python dependencies, and installs `aicommit`.

### Linting
```sh
make lint
```
- Runs [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) to check code style and quality.

### Formatting
```sh
make format
```
- Automatically formats your code using ruff.

### Testing
```sh
make test
```
- Runs all tests using pytest.

### Cleaning
```sh
make clean
```
- Removes build artifacts, caches, and all `__pycache__` directories.

### AI Commit and Push
```sh
make cm
```
- Stages all changes, generates an AI-powered commit message, and pushes to the remote repository.
- Runs both `ai-commit-and-readme` and `aicommit`.

### Test Coverage
```sh
make coverage
```
- Runs tests with coverage, displays a summary, and generates an HTML report in the `htmlcov` directory.

### Deploy Wiki
```sh
make deploy-wiki
```
- Copies the contents of your local `wiki/` directory to the GitHub Wiki repository and pushes the changes.
