## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands Overview

(Here you would include the updated content reflecting the changes in the Makefile. For instance, if a new command was added, you would add a description of the command, the syntax, and an example usage if applicable. If a command was removed or altered, you would update the section accordingly to reflect those changes, ensuring that users have the most current information for using the Makefile commands effectively.)
